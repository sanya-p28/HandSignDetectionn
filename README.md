American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition System
This project implements a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system focusing on hand detection and gesture interpretation using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

üöÄ Project Overview
The primary goal of this system is to lay the foundational groundwork for interpreting ASL gestures from real-time video feeds.

Currently, the system is capable of:

Real-time Hand Detection: Identifies hands (specifically distinguishing between left and right hands) in video streams.

Preparatory for Gesture Recognition: Establishes the initial detection capabilities necessary for future sign recognition.

Pre-trained Model Utilization: Leverages the power of the TensorFlow Object Detection API with transfer learning for efficient model training.

‚ú® Features
Real-time Processing: Designed for live video input from a webcam.

Hand Bounding Box Detection: Accurately locates and identifies left and right hands within the frame.

Foundational Hand Identification: Provides the base for integrating specific ASL sign recognition in future iterations.

Python & OpenCV: Core implementation uses Python for logic and OpenCV for video processing.

TensorFlow Integration: Utilizes TensorFlow for the underlying machine learning model.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras

TensorFlow Object Detection API

NumPy

Mediapipe (If used for hand tracking/landmarks)

labelImg (for annotation)

üì¶ Installation & Setup
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandSignDetectionn.git
cd HandSignDetectionn



(Replace your-username with your GitHub username)

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv



Activate the Virtual Environment:

Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate



macOS / Linux:

source venv/bin/activate



Install Dependencies:
Once your virtual environment is active, install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Download Pre-trained Model:


Prepare Dataset:


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Activate your virtual environment.

Run the data collection script:

python dataCollection.py



(This script might collect images or process existing ones, refer to its internal logic)

Run the detection/recognition script:

python test.py



(This script should open your webcam feed and perform real-time hand detection and identification of left/right hands.)

üìà Future Enhancements
Expand the ASL vocabulary to recognize specific signs beyond left/right hand detection.

Improve model robustness to variations in lighting, background, and signer styles.

Explore advanced deep learning architectures for higher accuracy in sign recognition.

Develop a more user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).

Integrate with text-to-speech for audible interpretation of signs.
